    <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: larger;">Mondelez International, Inc. (/ˌmɒndəˈliːz/ MAWN-də-LEEZ),[3] styled as Mondelēz International, is an American multinational confectionery, food, holding, beverage and snack food company based in Chicago.[4] Mondelez has an annual revenue of about $26.5 billion and operates in approximately 160 countries.[5] It ranked No. 108 in the 2021 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[6]

        The company has its origins as Kraft Foods Inc., which was founded in Chicago in 1923. The present enterprise was established in 2012 when Kraft Foods was renamed Mondelez and retained its snack food business, while its grocery business was spun off to a new company called Kraft Foods Group. The name is derived from the Latin word mundus ("world") and delez, a fanciful modification of the word "delicious."[7][8][9]
